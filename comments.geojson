Currently this area has not been highlighted to any zoning changes that would increase the area zone for high density commercial development.  I urge the city to keep it this way.  As a resident of the Morningside neighborhood, our streets are jam packed with cars all day & night.  As the traffic continues to increase on Monroe, Piedmont and Cheshire Bridge, more cars and commercial trucks cut through our neighborhood looking to avoid the bottlenecks.  As such, many of our streets are in terrible shape and it creates an unsafe environment for the residents as these vehicles often FAR exceed the speed limits.    Increasing commercial density, along with the plan to convert large sections of Monroe Drive from 4-lane to 3-lane, will only drive additional traffic into the neighborhood and negatively impact homeowners and residents.
